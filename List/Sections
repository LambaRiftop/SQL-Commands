## How is the repository structured?

This repository will be organized in three sections:

1. [**Commands**](commands)

    In this section, there will be a list of the different SQL commands, an explanation of how they can be used, and an example will be given.

2. [**Documents**](documents)
    
    This section is used to store documents useful for learning and exercises.

3. [**Exercises**](exercises)
    
    Here I will save the solved exercises together with the solution.
