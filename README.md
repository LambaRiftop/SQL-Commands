## What is this and its purpose?
This is a repository in which I store the knowledge that I have acquired during my studies at the university or in my spare time.

Its purpose is to aid my own learning and retention, while also serving as a resource for individuals beginning their journey as SQL Developers.

## Repository in progress

This repository is still in progress, so it is possible that some sections are not yet finish or avaible.

This will change little by little, as I acquire more knowledge and documents about Oracle-SQL and other things


## How is the repository structured?

The repository will be organized in three principal sections.

This sections are:

1. ### Commands

    In this section, there will be a list of the different SQL commands, an explanation of how they can be used, and an example will be given.
